# Kepler Demo - Building REST APIs with Relativity's Kepler Framework

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ Code found in this repository compliments the code seen in the [Building REST APIs with Relativity's Kepler Framework](https://www.relativity.com/ediscovery-training/self-paced/building-rest-apis-with-kepler-framework/) Webinar.

## Overview

This repository contains a sample Kepler service with a supporting agent to review building REST APIs with Relativity's Kepler Framework.

Kepler is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services based on .NET
interfaces.  You build a Kepler service using standard .NET contracts, and
Kepler builds an HTTP endpoint based on that contract.
